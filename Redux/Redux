Managing state in large web apps, or even smaller ones with less complexity, can be quite difficult.

Redux:

A single centralized place to contain the global state in your application, and specific patterns to follow when updating that state to make the code predictable.

1. Store
   Our Redux app's state and reducers are stored in a object called store.

2. Reducer

The reducer is responsible for returning a new state, and it does so depending on the action that is passed to it.

The reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action object as inputs and outputs the new state

3. Action

The action instructs the reducer on what to do with the state, such as changing it to a value we pass into the reducer from the action

<!--
 The reducer is responsible for actually changing the state of the application, while the action is in charge of specifying how it should change -->

Actions in detail :

In Redux, actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state of the application

Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.
They can also have additional properties to carry any necessary data.

 <!-- addTodoAction is an action with a type of 'ADD_TODO' and a payload property containing the data for the new todo item. -->

<!--

const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Buy groceries',
    completed: false
  }

};


-->

<!-- Action creators  -->

Actions are typically created using action creator functions, which are functions that return action objects.

Action creators make it easier to create actions with dynamic data.

<!--
 function addTodo(id, text) {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    payload: {
      id,
      text,
      completed: false
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const newTodoAction = addTodo(2, 'Walk the dog'); -->

<!--

Once an action is created, it is dispatched to the Redux store using the dispatch function.
The store then forwards the action to the reducer, which is a pure function responsible for updating the state based on the action type. -->

Summary

In Redux, actions are sent to reducers through the dispatch function. When you call dispatch with an action, Redux sends that action to every reducer in your application.

Reducers are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. Each reducer typically handles a specific slice of the state tree. Reducers are pure functions, meaning they don't mutate the state directly; instead, they return a new state object based on the old state and the action.

Redux Middlewares

Redux middleware is a powerful and flexible mechanism that allows you to extend the behavior of the Redux store's dispatch function. Middleware sits between the action being dispatched and the moment it reaches the reducer, providing a way to intercept, modify, or augment the actions and handle asynchronous operations.

const middleware = store => next => action => {
// Middleware logic here
next(action); // Pass the action to the next middleware or the reducer
};

//Order of Middlewares

const middleware1 = store => next => action => {
// Middleware 1 logic
next(action);
};

const middleware2 = store => next => action => {
// Middleware 2 logic
next(action);
};

const middleware3 = store => next => action => {
// Middleware 3 logic
next(action);
};

// Apply middleware to the store
const store = createStore(
rootReducer,
applyMiddleware(middleware1, middleware2, middleware3)
);

Top-Level Only: Hooks must be used at the top level of your functional components or custom hooks. They should not be called conditionally or inside loops.

// Valid
function MyComponent() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// ...

return (

<div>
{/_ ... _/}
</div>
);
}

// Invalid - Hooks must be at the top level
function InvalidComponent() {
if (condition) {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Error!
}

return (

<div>
{/_ ... _/}
</div>
);
}
